This is nothing more than a templated implementation of a double linked list.

The peculiarity is that the type T needs to support
	- next and prev public variables
	- status (true, false) as per active, wait


This is thought to support 2 linked lists in a single implementation. 

As long as the user specifies the head, the user can move nodes between the active and wait list.
This clearly is done to support run and wait queue in the OS. 

A graphical implementation on how to insert nodes and how to move them around is in the draw.io file
